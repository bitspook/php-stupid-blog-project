When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, about 2 inches in diameter.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else.<br />\r\n	He then asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the professor, &ldquo;I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things &ndash; your family, your partner, your health, your children &ndash; things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The pebbles are the other things that matter &ndash; like your job, your house, your car.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The sand is everything else. The small stuff.&rdquo;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&ldquo;If you put the sand into the jar first,&rdquo; he continued &ldquo;there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Take care of the rocks first &ndash; the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.&rdquo;</p>', '2012-06-20', 'If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuf', 1),
(30, 'You Were Made For This', '<p>\r\n	You are right in your assessments. The lustre and hubris some have aspired to while endorsing acts so heinous against children, elders, everyday people, the poor, the unguarded, the helpless, is breathtaking. Yet, I urge you, ask you, gentle you, to please not spend your spirit dry by bewailing these difficult times. Especially do not lose hope. Most particularly because, the fact is that we were made for these times. Yes. For years, we have been learning, practicing, been in training for and just waiting to meet on this exact plain of engagement.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	I grew up on the Great Lakes and recognize a seaworthy vessel when I see one. Regarding awakened souls, there have never been more able vessels in the waters than there are right now across the world. And they are fully provisioned and able to signal one another as never before in the history of humankind.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Look out over the prow; there are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you. Even though your veneers may shiver from every wave in this stormy roil, I assure you that the long timbers composing your prow and rudder come from a greater forest. That long-grained lumber is known to withstand storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. There is a tendency, too, to fall into being weakened by dwelling on what is outside your reach, by what cannot yet be. Do not focus there. That is spending the wind without raising the sails.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	We are needed, that is all we can know. And though we meet resistance, we more so will meet great souls who will hail us, love us and guide us, and we will know them when they appear. Didn&#39;t you say you were a believer? Didn&#39;t you say you pledged to listen to a voice greater? Didn&#39;t you ask for grace? Don&#39;t you remember that to be in grace means to submit to the voice greater?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	What is needed for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to, adding more, continuing. We know that it does not take everyone on Earth to bring justice and peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during the first, second, or hundredth gale.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul. Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times. The light of the soul throws sparks, can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these &ndash; to be fierce and to show mercy toward others; both are acts of immense bravery and greatest necessity.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Struggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one of the strongest things you can do.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	There will always be times when you feel discouraged. I too have felt despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it. I will not entertain it. It is not allowed to eat from my plate.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The reason is this: In my uttermost bones I know something, as do you. It is that there can be no despair when you remember why you came to Earth, who you serve, and who sent you here. The good words we say and the good deeds we do are not ours. They are the words and deeds of the One who brought us here. In that spirit, I hope you will write this on your wall: When a great ship is in harbor and moored, it is safe, there can be no doubt. But that is not what great ships are built for.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Clarissa Pinkola Estes, Ph.D<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Author of the best seller Women Who Run with the Wolves</p>', '2012-06-20', 'My friends, do not lose heart.

(31, 'Failure Is Not A Bad Word', '<p>\r\n	If the world would look at each one of us and ask us a question - &quot;Are you a success or failure?&quot; Would that intimidate you? What would be your response?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Today being successful is one of the highest priorities, whether you are a school kid or a steel tycoon. Our lifestyle seems to focus so much on success and achievement. There are innumerable success courses, seminars, workshops, mind training programs etc, that promise to launch us in to the trajectory of success and these things are wonderful!<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Now, the issue at hand is - What is our stand on failures? Where do failures fall in our lives? Are failures totally worthless?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	People who are failures, according to the world&#39;s standard, do not get to have the warm reception that only winners seem to enjoy. Of course that is understandable. But is it only the warm reception that is important here or something more?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	At this instant it would do all of us a lot of good to think about this - Somebody said, &quot;No one is a failure; it is just their experience.&quot; But many unfortunately seem to be roped into the bandwagon of &#39;success chasing&#39;.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Psychologists, working with students, say from the time when a child enters school, he/she tends to get impressed with the idea that success is the means to be respected and have a meaningful existence; to say it in simple terms: Success is &#39;the only way&#39; to have a fulfilled life.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	How then would we look at failures with the prevalent notion is that &quot;Only winning is worthwhile and only winners are remembered?&quot; Would it be unwise on our part to say that there is a general misrepresentation of failures in life?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	How many times do parents treat their children harshly for having a setback either in academic/sports/personal behavior? Denis Waitely said, &quot;There are no mistakes or failures only lessons.&quot;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	How many teachers teach children and young minds that failure equally ennobles us as success? How many of them teach that it is not failing but staying stagnant and not endeavoring to advance, that wanes and wastes us?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Everyone agrees that failures teach us humility, keep us from becoming arrogant and teach us perseverance. But when it comes to experiencing them personally, almost all of us cringe and balk. Why?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	An Indian writer once wrote, &quot;When failures teach us more lessons than success, shouldn&#39;t failures be celebrated more?&quot;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	There is a lot of insight in that statement. Yes!!! Failures really are so important in our lives. Failures are the things that make success enjoyable and worthy. Only thirst makes us realize the worth of water. It is the same with hunger and food. If it is true of these natural physical phenomena and things, then success (which is also &#39;natural&#39; because the drive to succeed is in everyone) too amounts to any worth only if one experiences the presence of failure.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Norman Vincent Peale observes in one of his books that a person who is getting &#39;C&#39; grades in college need not feel inferior/low for who knows, his real &#39;A&#39;s in life might start coming in when he qualifies and steps out of his college.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	So true! The world has many such success stories; stories of people who went on to make millions after the age when most of the people would retire; stories of people who invented when they were quite old. History is emblazoned with instances where a person, condemned as a failure, became unstoppable and rose to supremacy, before the eyes of the very same people who stamped and sealed him as failure.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	What should make us think that we are... done for... we are doomed... we are failures? Hence, we ought to stop trying to shun away failures or keep ourselves oblivious of our failures. People say that the more you loathe failures the more they irk you.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Have you ever looked at a stone on top of a mountain? Does it have failures? No! Is it alive? A big no! Only a living being can have failures. Failures are a signs of life. Failures are absolutely essential for each one of us.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	So the best way to tackle failures is to adorn our lips with a wonderful smile and tell ourselves, &quot;Hello! Be glad you have failures in life. If there were no failures, there would be no lessons and no real achievement can ever come without lessons.&quot;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The most important thing that each of us has to do is to be &#39;kind to ourselves&#39; when we fail, instead of &#39;judging ourselves&#39; and wallowing in self-pity; let us rethink our philosophy of success.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Of course failure has its own pain and no one can deny that. But it is like the pain that comes out of exercise that makes one fit. It is worth repeating what someone said - Anything that doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger. Hence, instead of thinking failures are final, let us rejoice that we have another lesson to learn.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Who on earth would be ungrateful to a person for a favor done? Failures do the same to us. They help us in so many ways. Why not be grateful for our failures? Now I am not being so superficial to say that we need not feel pain. It is just that we need to accept pain as willingly as we would when we receive help from someone.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	What would be our answer if someone asked us this question:<br />\r\n	&quot;Have you celebrated your recent failure?&quot;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	This might seem an insane question to many but truly there is lot in it for us to meditate. Basically we have to learn to gladly accept, not gruntingly call in, failures if they make their presence at our doorstep.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Now this doesn&#39;t mean that we go around making failure a thing of pride but, learn to keep failures in proper perspective so that they serve us instead of cut us. If we make friends with failures, be it personal or beyond, we truly don&#39;t have any enemies. It also doesn&#39;t mean we go jumping around because we failed. We need to handle them with poise and thankfulness because we learn from them too.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The Bible records instances where people who experienced failures finally ended as successes because they calmly accepted their failures and lived by what they said vis-a-vis &#39;We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair.&#39;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	If only we will recognize the importance of failures in our lives, we would not be so against them. We would even be thankful sometimes that they came our way. Now think about this - &quot;True success rests not in the basking while succeeding, but in the sereneness of a man to throw a party after hitting rock bottom&quot;. Hence let us celebrate our failures and calibrate our lives to success!<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	--- Copyright &copy; 2011 Sam Vijay Kumar<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	About the Author: I am a biotechnologist from India, working in the field of bio-medical research, with interest in theology, positive thinking, philosophy, creative writing and in living a purposeful life, thereby contributing to fellow humans.

(32, 'Are You Game Enough?', '<p>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Everyone wants to be known as &#39;Courageous&#39;. Courage is a wonderful feat to achieve. It is not only displayed by soldiers in a war field who faithfully defend their country; every field of work requires courage at various levels. The very fact that &#39;right now&#39; you are interested in something positive, which has life changing potential, proves the courage in you.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Courage can be understood in many ways and one of them is by studying the one thing that tends to antagonize, neutralize and negate it: Fear.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Fear is one of the most crippling things... one can even say that it is &#39;the&#39; most crippling thing in anyone&#39;s life. Fear can make a person perform far below his/her abilities, say sports authorities. Fear makes music incoherent, attest composers. Medicine says that fear can even cause paralysis. Fear causes school drop outs. So goes the saga of fear...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Now, not all fears are bad. Fear, as authorities in psychology say, is good until it starts to freeze us, halts our thinking and stops our progress. If fear stimulates us into a constructive, preparative action then it is good. If fear causes one to chart out a plan and act upon it, then it is the kind which is natural and helpful, for it helps us to organize and make our lives better. Any other type of fear would do no benefit.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Our present social situation, if one can say, is unfortunately &#39;fraught with fear&#39;. A student in a class is afraid to ask doubts. An Employee is afraid to ask his boss for a day of leave. On a global scale, we fear terror attacks. Even many people think about the future predictions of catastrophes and sit scared. It is also not uncommon in families where pessimism causes a person to fear an unlikely situation of someone deserting them, or the insecure feeling making a parent fearful about the wellbeing of his/her kids when they are away on a college excursion.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Sometimes we do encounter statements like, &#39;Accidents are on the rise, and I better stay back than make the trip on the highway&#39;. Some might say, &#39;What if I catch flu? Might as well be inside the house as the weather seems unwelcoming&#39;. These things show how much fear has encroached into the society.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The line in a famous movie, &#39;Terrified, mortified, petrified, stupefied by you...&#39; seems to describe many. The only difference is that the &#39;you&#39; in the statement is substituted with many other things: Divorce, illness, defamations, debts, opinions, boss (uh-huh) etc.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	What are your fears? How many of them are irrational?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Now let me reiterate this: right now we are not at aiming to highlight the prevalence of fear nor are we glorifying its powers but just attempting to illuminate a bit more on how intense this issue is today.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	But the actual truth is (as very many thinkers before us have declared, after careful observations) - The adverse events that we fear, for the most part, exist only in our imagination, i.e. we deliberately imagine fearful situations which for the most part would never happen in actuality. We tend to conjure frightening situations and imagine ourselves getting entangled in them.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The sufferer of such a malady unfortunately experiences the consequences of his/her negative imagination in real time, in the form of palpitation, sweating, headache, lack of drive, lack of confidence etc. A person can even end up a Neurotic in a hospital, if he or she continually fears something.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	We cannot afford to waste our life on fear as apparently, fear wastes our lives and bodies so badly.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	How many opportunities are lost just because we did not have the boldness to press on? How many promotions are lost just because we don&#39;t have the nerve to ask the superior? How many people miss their soul mates just because they did not have the guts to go and pursue their love?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The numbers are immaterial. The thing needed now is that such unneeded fears, spoilers that they are, can be and have to be eliminated.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Somebody said, &quot;To do the very thing you fear is to kill that fear&quot;. It is true. Sometimes we need to do the very thing that we are afraid will hurt us. Norman Vincent Peale said, &quot;You never do wrong by doing right&quot;. When we fear a situation, it would help us to sit back in our chair and do some honest heart searching and ask ourselves - &#39;what is the right thing to do now?&#39; Then we should strive to do that right thing i.e. act with courage no matter what the odds are.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&quot;Courage is being afraid but going on anyhow&quot; said Dan Rather. If our heart says what the right thing to do is, we have to bolster ourselves up and go forward, in spite of our temptations to wind up under the pressure.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	It has also been observed by many throughout the centuries that usually it is the first couple of steps that are the toughest in any endeavour. So for us to overcome the inertia and take the first few steps towards what we want would not be the easiest, but as we boldly step up, we will surely find that our fears don&#39;t have one hundredth of the strength we think they have.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Remember my friend: You are bigger than your fears! And any one can make a commitment today to take first hand measures to bring down the unpleasant consequences of illegitimate fears by doing the very thing they fear. Are you game enough?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Then...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; ask for your pay raise...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; make new friends...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; exhibit yourself in the talent show...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; ask the hand of the lovely lady in marriage...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; speak boldly without fearing the critics...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; pursue your passion, even under pressure...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; live like an eagle, undaunted, fearless...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Go; Do the right thing...<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Be brave and live a courageous life!<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	--- Copyright &copy; 2011 Sam Vijay Kumar<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	About the Author: I am a biotechnologist from India, working in the field of bio-medical research, with interest in theology, positive thinking, philosophy, creative writing and in living a purposeful life, thereby contributing to fellow humans.

With a community and plugin ecosystem as passionate as this one, it just might be impossible for any other editor to catch up.

If, like me, you want to use the latest possible version of the app, you can download the dev build. You&rsquo;ll find that new (auto) updates are available every other day or so.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Download a dev build of Sublime 2 here.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	2 &ndash; Get a Better Icon<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Update: here is a better icon.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In its defense, Sublime Text 2 is still in a beta state. The official icon will likely/hopefully change with the official release. Until then, Nate Beaty created an alternative icon, if you prefer it.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	To integrate it, you need to replace the existing &ldquo;Sublime Text 2.icns&rdquo; file with this new one. On a Mac, browse to Sublime 2 in your Applications/ folder, then right-click and &ldquo;View Package Contents.&rdquo; Lastly, browse to Contents/Resources/, and drag the new icon in, overwriting the existing one.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Please take note of the fact that, if you&rsquo;re using the frequently updated development version of Sublime Text, with each update, the icon will be removed. With that in mind, don&rsquo;t worry about the icon for the time being.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	3 &ndash; Access the Command Palette<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Similar to TextMate, we can use Sublime&rsquo;s command palette by accessing the Tools menu, or by pressing Shift + Command + P, on the Mac. Whether you need to visit a Preferences page, or paste in a snippet, all of that can be accomplished here.<br />\r\n	4 &ndash; Lightning-Fast File Switching<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Press Control or Command + P, type in the name of the file you wish to access (fuzzy finder), and, without even pressing Enter, you&rsquo;ll instantly be transported to that file. While Vim and apps like PeepOpen offer a similar functionality, they&rsquo;re not nearly as fast as Sublime&rsquo;s implementation.<br />\r\n	5 &ndash; How Did We Survive Before Multi-Selection?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Editors like TextMate have long offered vertical selection, which is quite neat. But, with multi-selection, you can have multiple cursors on the page. This can drastically reduce the need for using regular expressions, and advanced search and replace queries. Perhaps a quick visual demonstration is in order&hellip;<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	To enable multi-selection, you have several options:<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Press Alt or Command and then click in each region where you require a cursor.<br />\r\n	Select a block of lines, and then press Shift + Command + L.<br />\r\n	Place the cursor over a particular word, and press Control/Command + D repeatedly to select additional occurrences of that word.<br />\r\n	Alternatively, add an additional cursor at all occurrences of a word by typing Alt+F3 on Windows, or Ctrl+Command+G on the Mac. Amazing!!<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	6 &ndash; Indent Guides<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Update: this feature now comes preinstalled with Sublime Text 2.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	It&rsquo;s such a small feature, but I&rsquo;ve always loved how Notepad++ on Windows displays indent guides; it makes the page much easier to navigate and format. Sublime Text 2 offers this ability, via a plugin created by Nikolaus Wittenstein.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	To integrate this plugin:<br />\r\n	7 &ndash; Package Control<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	The steps outlined in the previous tip (#6) are a bit tedious, aren&rsquo;t they? Instead, we can install the excellent Sublime Package Control, which streamlines the entire process.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	To install &ldquo;Package Control,&rdquo; open Sublime and press Control + `. Next, paste the following snippet into the console.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	import urllib2,os;pf=&#39;Package Control.sublime-package&#39;;ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path();os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None;open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),&#39;wb&#39;).write(urllib2.urlopen(&#39;http://sublime.wbond.net/&#39;+pf.replace(&#39; &#39;,&#39;%20&#39;)).read())<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t understand the code above; just copy and paste!<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Lastly, restart Sublime Text, and browse to Preferences -&gt; Package Settings. If the installation was successful, you&rsquo;ll now see a Package Control item in that list.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	With Package Control installed, the process of adding new plugins and functionality becomes incredibly simple!<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	For a usage example, refer to the next item in this list.</p>', '2012-06-20', 'Sublime Text 2 is currently available for all major platforms: OS X, Linux and Windows.', 2),

It begins with a decision that no matter what, you are going to live your life as a work of art.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Michelangelo said that David was already in the block of Marble before he started carving. All he did was to chip away the marble that was imprisoning the sculpture allowing David to be born.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	So too is it with Your own life. You have a special inbuilt potential to be something truly wonderful, something magnificent. All it takes is two very important things :<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	A dream and actions.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	It&#39;s just like putting paint on canvas. When Sofan paints, she starts with a clear idea of what she wants to create, a brilliant image shining in her mind. Slowly, one brush stroke at a time is applied until after much time and joy, the painting appears. The wonderful image in her mind comes alive for other people to see and experience.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Every thought you think and every one of your actions is like a brush stoke on the canvas of our lives. To live your life as a work of art it is first necessary to have a clear idea of what it is that you really want to do, and then make the commitment that no matter what, you will take the necessary steps to achieve this dream.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Sadly, most people only know what they don&#39;t want to do. They are so busy, so caught up in living their day to day existence, that they are unable to take the time to really think about what they want to be doing. We all need a special dream to spur us on towards actions. It all begins with a dream. Your dream. What is it ?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Knowing what your dream is the beginning of living your life as a magnificent work of Art. So take the time, think about it. Once you truly know what you really want to do, actions follow, until before you know it, your dream is taking shape all around you.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	So over this coming week, take the time to think about what it is that you really want to be doing. Truly ask yourself, are you doing it now ? If your answer is no, then you must, ask your self why not ?<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	May your life be filled with love, happiness and inspiration.</p>', '2012-11-11', 'Sadly, most people only know what they don''t want to do.
