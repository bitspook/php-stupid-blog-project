(26, 'Nothing Comes Easy', 'It''s kind of funny to keep watching people who want things to come easy to them in life.  Many other people know of this tendency among human beings, so they keep selling them diet pills that let them eat whatever they want, job information that will make them rich with no effort, college &quot;degrees&quot; that require no study at all, and many other &quot;easy&quot; fixes to their problems, easy fulfillment of their desires.  But over and over again these people who want the easy ways out are disappointed, for what they hoped and expected would help them simply has left them still with their problems and now with a little less money in their pockets and wallets.\r\n\r\nI''m coaching a high school girls'' basketball team right now, one that not only has a brand-new coach (me), but that also lost most of their players from last year.  We''ve adopted the slogan &quot;Nothing Comes Easy&quot; for this year, mainly because we all knew that we would have a long and difficult road ahead of us--that is, if we wanted to accomplish anything significant.  We definitely could have taken the easy road and doomed ourselves to a winless season, or we could have worked very hard to try to become more than anyone expected.  And while we haven''t come out as a Cinderella team that in the movies would win all of their games against much tougher teams, we have become a team that''s extremely competitive, and that already has won more games than anyone expected us to.\r\n	\r\n\r\nThat all comes from having a realistic perspective, I believe.  We know that we aren''t a very experienced team, and that means that we have to work harder than the other teams, both on and off the court.  We have to work harder during games, and we have to work harder during practice.  And that''s fine with us, because as long as we know that nothing is going to come easy to us, we''re ready and willing to pay the price necessary to improve.\r\n\r\nSaying that &quot;nothing comes easy&quot; isn''t at all defeatist or cynical.  It''s a fact that''s been proved over and over in life, as major scientific breakthroughs come after years and years of research and hard work; financial stability comes after years of sacrifice and effort; great movies and albums are made with the most effort and practice and planning and preparation.  Colonel Sanders had to visit over 100 restaurants before he sold his recipe for fried chicken, and that came after years of perfecting that recipe.  Richard Bach received over 70 rejections for Jonathan Livingston Seagull, and that was after all the time and effort it took him to write the book.\r\n\r\nHistory is full of examples of great successes and great results after a lot of effort and time.  There are, of course, the exceptions--those people who have found success almost immediately, with almost no work involved.  But they truly are the exceptions rather than the rule.  And that type of success rarely is lasting, either.\r\n\r\nWhen we remind ourselves that nothing truly worthwhile comes easy, we can face our obstacles and problems with more equanimity, and we can be much more calm in the face of setbacks.  When we know that it''s going to take time and work to reach a goal, we''re much more likely to accept delays as necessary elements of the process, and we''re much more likely to see obstacles as learning opportunities rather than back-breakers.  Keeping in mind that nothing comes easy, we can give our best effort because we know that it''s that effort--as well as the time involved--that''s going to craft a fine finished product.', '2012-06-10', 'Inspirtaional article by tom walsh'),
(27, 'The important things in life', 'A philosophy professor stood before his class with some items on the table in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, about 2 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nHe then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.\r\n\r\nSo the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks.\r\n\r\nHe then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.\r\n\r\nThe professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else.\r\nHe then asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous â€œYes.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œNow,â€ said the professor, â€œI want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things â€“ your family, your partner, your health, your children â€“ things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles are the other things that matter â€“ like your job, your house, your car.\r\n\r\nThe sand is everything else. The small stuff.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œIf you put the sand into the jar first,â€ he continued â€œthere is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life.\r\n\r\nIf you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal.\r\n\r\nTake care of the rocks first â€“ the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.â€', '2012-06-10', 'If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuf'),
(30, 'You Were Made For This', 'You are right in your assessments. The lustre and hubris some have aspired to while endorsing acts so heinous against children, elders, everyday people, the poor, the unguarded, the helpless, is breathtaking. Yet, I urge you, ask you, gentle you, to please not spend your spirit dry by bewailing these difficult times. Especially do not lose hope. Most particularly because, the fact is that we were made for these times. Yes. For years, we have been learning, practicing, been in training for and just waiting to meet on this exact plain of engagement.\r\n\r\nI grew up on the Great Lakes and recognize a seaworthy vessel when I see one. Regarding awakened souls, there have never been more able vessels in the waters than there are right now across the world. And they are fully provisioned and able to signal one another as never before in the history of humankind.\r\n\r\nLook out over the prow; there are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you. Even though your veneers may shiver from every wave in this stormy roil, I assure you that the long timbers composing your prow and rudder come from a greater forest. That long-grained lumber is known to withstand storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless.\r\n\r\nIn any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. There is a tendency, too, to fall into being weakened by dwelling on what is outside your reach, by what cannot yet be. Do not focus there. That is spending the wind without raising the sails.\r\n\r\nWe are needed, that is all we can know. And though we meet resistance, we more so will meet great souls who will hail us, love us and guide us, and we will know them when they appear. Didn''t you say you were a believer? Didn''t you say you pledged to listen to a voice greater? Didn''t you ask for grace? Don''t you remember that to be in grace means to submit to the voice greater?\r\n\r\nOurs is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to, adding more, continuing. We know that it does not take everyone on Earth to bring justice and peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during the first, second, or hundredth gale.\r\n\r\nOne of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul. Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times. The light of the soul throws sparks, can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these â€“ to be fierce and to show mercy toward others; both are acts of immense bravery and greatest necessity.\r\n\r\nStruggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one of the strongest things you can do.\r\n\r\nThere will always be times when you feel discouraged. I too have felt despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it. I will not entertain it. It is not allowed to eat from my plate.\r\n\r\nThe reason is this: In my uttermost bones I know something, as do you. It is that there can be no despair when you remember why you came to Earth, who you serve, and who sent you here. The good words we say and the good deeds we do are not ours. They are the words and deeds of the One who brought us here. In that spirit, I hope you will write this on your wall: When a great ship is in harbor and moored, it is safe, there can be no doubt. But that is not what great ships are built for.\r\n\r\n\r\nClarissa Pinkola Estes, Ph.D\r\n\r\nAuthor of the best seller Women Who Run with the Wolves', '2012-06-10', 'My friends, do not lose heart. We were made for these things.'),
(31, 'Failure Is Not A Bad Word', 'If the world would look at each one of us and ask us a question - "Are you a success or failure?" Would that intimidate you? What would be your response?\r\n\r\nToday being successful is one of the highest priorities, whether you are a school kid or a steel tycoon. Our lifestyle seems to focus so much on success and achievement. There are innumerable success courses, seminars, workshops, mind training programs etc, that promise to launch us in to the trajectory of success and these things are wonderful!\r\n\r\nNow, the issue at hand is - What is our stand on failures? Where do failures fall in our lives? Are failures totally worthless?\r\n\r\nPeople who are failures, according to the world''s standard, do not get to have the warm reception that only winners seem to enjoy. Of course that is understandable. But is it only the warm reception that is important here or something more?\r\n\r\nAt this instant it would do all of us a lot of good to think about this - Somebody said, "No one is a failure; it is just their experience." But many unfortunately seem to be roped into the bandwagon of ''success chasing''.\r\n\r\nPsychologists, working with students, say from the time when a child enters school, he/she tends to get impressed with the idea that success is the means to be respected and have a meaningful existence; to say it in simple terms: Success is ''the only way'' to have a fulfilled life.\r\n\r\nHow then would we look at failures with the prevalent notion is that "Only winning is worthwhile and only winners are remembered?" Would it be unwise on our part to say that there is a general misrepresentation of failures in life?\r\n\r\nHow many times do parents treat their children harshly for having a setback either in academic/sports/personal behavior? Denis Waitely said, "There are no mistakes or failures only lessons."\r\n\r\nHow many teachers teach children and young minds that failure equally ennobles us as success? How many of them teach that it is not failing but staying stagnant and not endeavoring to advance, that wanes and wastes us?\r\n\r\nEveryone agrees that failures teach us humility, keep us from becoming arrogant and teach us perseverance. But when it comes to experiencing them personally, almost all of us cringe and balk. Why?\r\n\r\nAn Indian writer once wrote, "When failures teach us more lessons than success, shouldn''t failures be celebrated more?"\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of insight in that statement. Yes!!! Failures really are so important in our lives. Failures are the things that make success enjoyable and worthy. Only thirst makes us realize the worth of water. It is the same with hunger and food. If it is true of these natural physical phenomena and things, then success (which is also ''natural'' because the drive to succeed is in everyone) too amounts to any worth only if one experiences the presence of failure.\r\n\r\nNorman Vincent Peale observes in one of his books that a person who is getting ''C'' grades in college need not feel inferior/low for who knows, his real ''A''s in life might start coming in when he qualifies and steps out of his college.\r\n\r\nSo true! The world has many such success stories; stories of people who went on to make millions after the age when most of the people would retire; stories of people who invented when they were quite old. History is emblazoned with instances where a person, condemned as a failure, became unstoppable and rose to supremacy, before the eyes of the very same people who stamped and sealed him as failure.\r\n\r\nWhat should make us think that we are... done for... we are doomed... we are failures? Hence, we ought to stop trying to shun away failures or keep ourselves oblivious of our failures. People say that the more you loathe failures the more they irk you.\r\n\r\nHave you ever looked at a stone on top of a mountain? Does it have failures? No! Is it alive? A big no! Only a living being can have failures. Failures are a signs of life. Failures are absolutely essential for each one of us.\r\n\r\nSo the best way to tackle failures is to adorn our lips with a wonderful smile and tell ourselves, "Hello! Be glad you have failures in life. If there were no failures, there would be no lessons and no real achievement can ever come without lessons."\r\n\r\nThe most important thing that each of us has to do is to be ''kind to ourselves'' when we fail, instead of ''judging ourselves'' and wallowing in self-pity; let us rethink our philosophy of success.\r\n\r\nOf course failure has its own pain and no one can deny that. But it is like the pain that comes out of exercise that makes one fit. It is worth repeating what someone said - Anything that doesn''t kill you makes you stronger. Hence, instead of thinking failures are final, let us rejoice that we have another lesson to learn.\r\n\r\nWho on earth would be ungrateful to a person for a favor done? Failures do the same to us. They help us in so many ways. Why not be grateful for our failures? Now I am not being so superficial to say that we need not feel pain. It is just that we need to accept pain as willingly as we would when we receive help from someone.\r\n\r\nWhat would be our answer if someone asked us this question:\r\n"Have you celebrated your recent failure?"\r\n\r\nThis might seem an insane question to many but truly there is lot in it for us to meditate. Basically we have to learn to gladly accept, not gruntingly call in, failures if they make their presence at our doorstep.\r\n\r\nNow this doesn''t mean that we go around making failure a thing of pride but, learn to keep failures in proper perspective so that they serve us instead of cut us. If we make friends with failures, be it personal or beyond, we truly don''t have any enemies. It also doesn''t mean we go jumping around because we failed. We need to handle them with poise and thankfulness because we learn from them too.\r\n\r\nThe Bible records instances where people who experienced failures finally ended as successes because they calmly accepted their failures and lived by what they said vis-a-vis ''We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair.''\r\n\r\nIf only we will recognize the importance of failures in our lives, we would not be so against them. We would even be thankful sometimes that they came our way. Now think about this - "True success rests not in the basking while succeeding, but in the sereneness of a man to throw a party after hitting rock bottom". Hence let us celebrate our failures and calibrate our lives to success!\r\n\r\n--- Copyright Â© 2011 Sam Vijay Kumar\r\n\r\nAbout the Author: I am a biotechnologist from India, working in the field of bio-medical research, with interest in theology, positive thinking, philosophy, creative writing and in living a purposeful life, thereby contributing to fellow humans.

(32, 'Are You Game Enough?', 'Everyone wants to be known as ''Courageous''. Courage is a wonderful feat to achieve. It is not only displayed by soldiers in a war field who faithfully defend their country; every field of work requires courage at various levels. The very fact that ''right now'' you are interested in something positive, which has life changing potential, proves the courage in you.\r\n\r\nCourage can be understood in many ways and one of them is by studying the one thing that tends to antagonize, neutralize and negate it: Fear.\r\n\r\nFear is one of the most crippling things... one can even say that it is ''the'' most crippling thing in anyone''s life. Fear can make a person perform far below his/her abilities, say sports authorities. Fear makes music incoherent, attest composers. Medicine says that fear can even cause paralysis. Fear causes school drop outs. So goes the saga of fear...\r\n\r\nNow, not all fears are bad. Fear, as authorities in psychology say, is good until it starts to freeze us, halts our thinking and stops our progress. If fear stimulates us into a constructive, preparative action then it is good. If fear causes one to chart out a plan and act upon it, then it is the kind which is natural and helpful, for it helps us to organize and make our lives better. Any other type of fear would do no benefit.\r\n\r\nOur present social situation, if one can say, is unfortunately ''fraught with fear''. A student in a class is afraid to ask doubts. An Employee is afraid to ask his boss for a day of leave. On a global scale, we fear terror attacks. Even many people think about the future predictions of catastrophes and sit scared. It is also not uncommon in families where pessimism causes a person to fear an unlikely situation of someone deserting them, or the insecure feeling making a parent fearful about the wellbeing of his/her kids when they are away on a college excursion.\r\n\r\nSometimes we do encounter statements like, ''Accidents are on the rise, and I better stay back than make the trip on the highway''. Some might say, ''What if I catch flu? Might as well be inside the house as the weather seems unwelcoming''. These things show how much fear has encroached into the society.\r\n\r\nThe line in a famous movie, ''Terrified, mortified, petrified, stupefied by you...'' seems to describe many. The only difference is that the ''you'' in the statement is substituted with many other things: Divorce, illness, defamations, debts, opinions, boss (uh-huh) etc.\r\n\r\nWhat are your fears? How many of them are irrational?\r\n\r\nNow let me reiterate this: right now we are not at aiming to highlight the prevalence of fear nor are we glorifying its powers but just attempting to illuminate a bit more on how intense this issue is today.\r\n\r\nBut the actual truth is (as very many thinkers before us have declared, after careful observations) - The adverse events that we fear, for the most part, exist only in our imagination, i.e. we deliberately imagine fearful situations which for the most part would never happen in actuality. We tend to conjure frightening situations and imagine ourselves getting entangled in them.\r\n\r\nThe sufferer of such a malady unfortunately experiences the consequences of his/her negative imagination in real time, in the form of palpitation, sweating, headache, lack of drive, lack of confidence etc. A person can even end up a Neurotic in a hospital, if he or she continually fears something.\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford to waste our life on fear as apparently, fear wastes our lives and bodies so badly.\r\n\r\nHow many opportunities are lost just because we did not have the boldness to press on? How many promotions are lost just because we don''t have the nerve to ask the superior? How many people miss their soul mates just because they did not have the guts to go and pursue their love?\r\n\r\nThe numbers are immaterial. The thing needed now is that such unneeded fears, spoilers that they are, can be and have to be eliminated.\r\n\r\nSomebody said, "To do the very thing you fear is to kill that fear". It is true. Sometimes we need to do the very thing that we are afraid will hurt us. Norman Vincent Peale said, "You never do wrong by doing right". When we fear a situation, it would help us to sit back in our chair and do some honest heart searching and ask ourselves - ''what is the right thing to do now?'' Then we should strive to do that right thing i.e. act with courage no matter what the odds are.\r\n\r\n"Courage is being afraid but going on anyhow" said Dan Rather. If our heart says what the right thing to do is, we have to bolster ourselves up and go forward, in spite of our temptations to wind up under the pressure.\r\n\r\nIt has also been observed by many throughout the centuries that usually it is the first couple of steps that are the toughest in any endeavour. So for us to overcome the inertia and take the first few steps towards what we want would not be the easiest, but as we boldly step up, we will surely find that our fears don''t have one hundredth of the strength we think they have.\r\n\r\nRemember my friend: You are bigger than your fears! And any one can make a commitment today to take first hand measures to bring down the unpleasant consequences of illegitimate fears by doing the very thing they fear. Are you game enough?\r\n\r\nThen...\r\n\r\nGo; ask for your pay raise...\r\n\r\nGo; make new friends...\r\n\r\nGo; exhibit yourself in the talent show...\r\n\r\nGo; ask the hand of the lovely lady in marriage...\r\n\r\nGo; speak boldly without fearing the critics...\r\n\r\nGo; pursue your passion, even under pressure...\r\n\r\nGo; live like an eagle, undaunted, fearless...\r\n\r\nGo; Do the right thing...\r\n\r\nBe brave and live a courageous life!\r\n\r\n--- Copyright Â© 2011 Sam Vijay Kumar\r\n\r\nAbout the Author: I am a biotechnologist from India, working in the field of bio-medical research, with interest in theology, positive thinking, philosophy, creative writing and in living a purposeful life, thereby contributing to fellow humans.

(33, 'Sublime Text 2 Tips and Tricks (Updated)', 'Sublime Text 2 is one of the fastest and most incredible code editors to be released in a long time! With a community and plugin ecosystem as passionate as this one, it just might be impossible for any other editor to catch up. Iâ€™ll show you my favorite tips and tricks today.\r\n\r\n    Sublime Text 2 is currently available for all major platforms: OS X, Linux and Windows.\r\n\r\n1 â€“ Bleeding Edge Versions\r\n\r\nSublime is in active development. If, like me, you want to use the latest possible version of the app, you can download the dev build. Youâ€™ll find that new (auto) updates are available every other day or so.\r\n\r\n    Download a dev build of Sublime 2 here.\r\n\r\n2 â€“ Get a Better Icon\r\n\r\n    Update: here is a better icon.\r\n\r\nIn its defense, Sublime Text 2 is still in a beta state. The official icon will likely/hopefully change with the official release. Until then, Nate Beaty created an alternative icon, if you prefer it.\r\n\r\nTo integrate it, you need to replace the existing â€œSublime Text 2.icnsâ€ file with this new one. On a Mac, browse to Sublime 2 in your Applications/ folder, then right-click and â€œView Package Contents.â€ Lastly, browse to Contents/Resources/, and drag the new icon in, overwriting the existing one.\r\n\r\n    Please take note of the fact that, if youâ€™re using the frequently updated development version of Sublime Text, with each update, the icon will be removed. With that in mind, donâ€™t worry about the icon for the time being.\r\n\r\n3 â€“ Access the Command Palette\r\n\r\nSimilar to TextMate, we can use Sublimeâ€™s command palette by accessing the Tools menu, or by pressing Shift + Command + P, on the Mac. Whether you need to visit a Preferences page, or paste in a snippet, all of that can be accomplished here.\r\n4 â€“ Lightning-Fast File Switching\r\n\r\nPress Control or Command + P, type in the name of the file you wish to access (fuzzy finder), and, without even pressing Enter, youâ€™ll instantly be transported to that file. While Vim and apps like PeepOpen offer a similar functionality, theyâ€™re not nearly as fast as Sublimeâ€™s implementation.\r\n5 â€“ How Did We Survive Before Multi-Selection?\r\n\r\nEditors like TextMate have long offered vertical selection, which is quite neat. But, with multi-selection, you can have multiple cursors on the page. This can drastically reduce the need for using regular expressions, and advanced search and replace queries. Perhaps a quick visual demonstration is in orderâ€¦\r\n\r\nTo enable multi-selection, you have several options:\r\n\r\n    Press Alt or Command and then click in each region where you require a cursor.\r\n    Select a block of lines, and then press Shift + Command + L.\r\n    Place the cursor over a particular word, and press Control/Command + D repeatedly to select additional occurrences of that word.\r\n    Alternatively, add an additional cursor at all occurrences of a word by typing Alt+F3 on Windows, or Ctrl+Command+G on the Mac. Amazing!!\r\n\r\n6 â€“ Indent Guides\r\n\r\nUpdate: this feature now comes preinstalled with Sublime Text 2.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s such a small feature, but Iâ€™ve always loved how Notepad++ on Windows displays indent guides; it makes the page much easier to navigate and format. Sublime Text 2 offers this ability, via a plugin created by Nikolaus Wittenstein.\r\n\r\nTo integrate this plugin:\r\n7 â€“ Package Control\r\n\r\nThe steps outlined in the previous tip (#6) are a bit tedious, arenâ€™t they? Instead, we can install the excellent Sublime Package Control, which streamlines the entire process.\r\n\r\nTo install â€œPackage Control,â€ open Sublime and press Control + `. Next, paste the following snippet into the console.\r\n\r\n import urllib2,os;pf=''Package Control.sublime-package'';ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path();os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None;open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),''wb'').write(urllib2.urlopen(''http://sublime.wbond.net/''+pf.replace('' '',''%20'')).read())\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t understand the code above; just copy and paste!\r\n\r\nLastly, restart Sublime Text, and browse to Preferences -> Package Settings. If the installation was successful, youâ€™ll now see a Package Control item in that list.\r\n\r\n    With Package Control installed, the process of adding new plugins and functionality becomes incredibly simple!\r\n\r\nFor a usage example, refer to the next item in this list.', '2012-06-10', 'Sublime Text 2 is currently available for all major platforms: OS X, Linux and Windows.'),
(34, 'How to turn your life into a Work of Art', 'What is it that you really want to do ?\r\n\r\nWhat is your own special dream that you want to live out ?\r\n\r\nDo you believe your life is going to be a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, or is it some smudged finger painting ?\r\n\r\nUltimately it begins with a choice. It begins with a decision that no matter what, you are going to live your life as a work of art.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo said that David was already in the block of Marble before he started carving. All he did was to chip away the marble that was imprisoning the sculpture allowing David to be born.\r\n\r\nSo too is it with Your own life. You have a special inbuilt potential to be something truly wonderful, something magnificent. All it takes is two very important things :\r\n\r\nA dream and actions.\r\n\r\nIt''s just like putting paint on canvas. When Sofan paints, she starts with a clear idea of what she wants to create, a brilliant image shining in her mind. Slowly, one brush stroke at a time is applied until after much time and joy, the painting appears. The wonderful image in her mind comes alive for other people to see and experience.\r\n\r\nEvery thought you think and every one of your actions is like a brush stoke on the canvas of our lives. To live your life as a work of art it is first necessary to have a clear idea of what it is that you really want to do, and then make the commitment that no matter what, you will take the necessary steps to achieve this dream.\r\n\r\nSadly, most people only know what they don''t want to do. They are so busy, so caught up in living their day to day existence, that they are unable to take the time to really think about what they want to be doing. We all need a special dream to spur us on towards actions. It all begins with a dream. Your dream. What is it ?\r\n\r\nKnowing what your dream is the beginning of living your life as a magnificent work of Art. So take the time, think about it. Once you truly know what you really want to do, actions follow, until before you know it, your dream is taking shape all around you.\r\n\r\nSo over this coming week, take the time to think about what it is that you really want to be doing. Truly ask yourself, are you doing it now ? If your answer is no, then you must, ask your self why not ?\r\n\r\nMay your life be filled with love, happiness and inspiration', '2012-06-10', 'Sadly, most people only know what they don''t want to do.

(35, 'How to discover your own special dream', 'The two most important steps in living your dreams are:-\r\n\r\nHaving a really clear idea about what it is that you want to do, and then taking the necessary actions towards achieving it.\r\n\r\nOur thoughts generate our actions and our actions eventually become the reality that we live out.\r\n\r\nA dream doesn''t have to mean some far off and impossible to achieve ideal. Rather a dream is like a seed, which if watered and fed with your thoughts and actions can grow into something more wondrous and beautiful than anything you can begin to imagine. There is such a truly amazing power in dreaming.\r\n\r\nAre you still not sure what is your own special dream ?\r\n\r\nHere is a wonderful and fun exercise which will inspire you to discover your own true destiny.\r\n\r\nStep 1:- Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed for at least ten minutes. This exercise can take much much longer, but you need to devote at least ten minutes to this.\r\n\r\nHey! it''s your life isn''t it ?\r\n\r\nStep 2:- This is the really really fun part. This is where you get to use your imagination. Just imagine you have a magic bottle and when you rub it out will pop this amazing genie who will ask you what is your wish ? You can have as many wishes as you like. No limitations on money, no limitations on distance, educational background or time. You can have anything at all. Let your mind roam free. Use your imagination. Start to dream.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of this exercise is to not dream too small. Having an easily achievable dream is not much fun at all. What is the point in having a dream that you will pay the rent on time next week ? Where''s the fun in that ? How about a dream that you own a really beautiful house on the water in some special place ? That''s a lot more fun. Isn''t it ?\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest tragedies of humankind is not that people''s dreams are too big that they can not achieve them, but that they are too small to inspire them. So dream BIG. Get yourself inspired.\r\n\r\nStep 3. Write it all down. Have fun, just pretend that this magic genie is going to grant you anything you ask. Want to be a famous singer or writer ? Write it down. Want to travel to far off places ? Write it down. Want a meaningful and loving relationship with someone really really special ? Write it down...... You have to give the genie some instructions to work with !\r\n\r\nNow, ten minutes isn''t really much time to spend doing this, so take the next week to really think about what fun experiences you would like to have during this precious life of yours. Remember, it can be anything at all. No limitations. Carry a notebook with you, and when at some odd moment a thought pops into your head that you would really like to do something, take out you notebook and write it down. The most important step in bringing your dreams into reality is to first really think about them, and then write them down.\r\n\r\nIt''s a bit like how Sofan creates one of her magnificent paintings. She starts with an idea of something she wants to create. Then she does a rough sketch in pencil on the canvas before she starts to apply the paint. So make your life sketch and you can fill in the details later. The important thing is to have fun while you are doing it.\r\n\r\nEventually, a pattern is likely to emerge which will indicate to you what is your true desire and dream for life. Even if it doesn''t emerge, the mere fact that you are "thinking" about your true dream and passion will work to draw this dream to reveal itself to you.\r\n\r\nWe all have a true goal and purpose in life. Something which goes beyond a mere occupation and enters the realm of the divine. Not everyone wants to be an artist or musician, not everyone want to be an astronaut or a world famous athlete. Your profession doesn''t really matter so long as you are pursuing it with love and inspiration. When you are truly living your dream, every day is a new adventure. You will awake full of energy and filled with excitement because whatever happens, it is part of your dream.\r\n\r\nSo over this coming week, have fun doing this exercise Because in order to take this wonderful journey on the path of life, it helps to know where you want to be going.\r\n\r\nMay your life be filled with love, happiness and inspiration', '2012-06-10', 'Our thoughts generate our actions and our actions eventually become the reality that we live out.');
